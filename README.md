## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend developer specialized in **Java** and **Spring Boot**. I focus on designing and implementing robust, scalable systems, applying **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. I have experience integrating **CI/CD** pipelines and efficiently managing **SQL** databases.

I also enjoy exploring the **DevOps** world as a hobby: managing **VPS**, virtual machines, services, and applications, always in **GNU/Linux** environments 🐧. I'm a strong advocate of **open source** and constantly seek to learn and share knowledge.
